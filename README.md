# DataCamp Projects
A collection of data science projects completed through DataCamp courses, demonstrating practical applications of machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

1. **Clustering Penguin Species**
   - Implemented K-means clustering algorithm to classify penguin species based on morphological features
   - Performed data preprocessing including standardization and one-hot encoding
   - Created visualizations using Seaborn to determine optimal number of clusters through elbow method
   - Analyzed cluster characteristics using mean values of culmen length, depth, and flipper length
   - Technologies used: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, numpy

2. **Hypothesis Testing in Soccer**
   - Conducted statistical analysis comparing goal scoring patterns in men's and women's FIFA World Cup matches
   - Filtered and analyzed match data from 2002 onwards for both tournaments
   - Implemented Mann-Whitney U test using pingouin library for non-parametric comparison
   - Created side-by-side histograms to visualize goal distribution differences
   - Technologies used: pandas, pingouin, seaborn, matplotlib

3. **Modeling Car Insurance**
   - Built predictive models to estimate likelihood of insurance claims
   - Analyzed 17 features including driver demographics, vehicle information, and driving history
   - Implemented logistic regression models for each feature to identify best predictor
   - Handled missing values in credit scores and annual mileage
   - Evaluated models using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics
   - Technologies used: statsmodels, pandas, numpy

4. **Modeling for Agriculture**
   - Analysis of soil measurements data for agricultural predictions
   - Study of various soil parameters and their relationships with crop yields
   - Implementation of predictive modeling techniques for agricultural outcomes
   - Focus on data-driven decision making in farming practices
   - Technologies used: Python data science stack

5. **Rental Price Prediction**
   - Machine learning approach to predict rental prices
   - Feature engineering and analysis of property characteristics
   - Implementation of regression models for price prediction
   - Evaluation of model performance and feature importance
   - Technologies used: Python machine learning libraries

Each project demonstrates practical application of data science concepts using real-world datasets. The implementations showcase various aspects of the data science workflow:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical testing and hypothesis validation
- Machine learning model development
- Data visualization and result interpretation

All projects are implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks, making use of popular data science libraries including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, seaborn, and matplotlib.
